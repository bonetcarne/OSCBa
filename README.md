# Open Science Community in Barcelona
## Open Life Science project - from January to April 2020 @open-life-science
### Vision statement
I am working with my mentor @Zebetus to create and hopefully establish an Open Science Community in Barcelona to promote knowledge exchange and discuss on how we could improve our research in terms of open science. Long term aim is  to use this community to create workshops and symposia about open science and to agree on some common needs. (Based on the Mozilla lesson “Intro to Open Leadership”)
